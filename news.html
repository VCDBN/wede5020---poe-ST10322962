      <h3>City X experiences record high levels of air pollution</h3>
      <p>Date: 20/06/2023</p>
      <p>Description: In metropolitan areas where air quality is monitored, more than 80% of residents are exposed to levels of air pollution that are higher than WHO standards. All parts of the world are impacted, but low-income city people are the most severely affected.
        98% of cities in low- and middle-income nations with more than 100 000 inhabitants do not fulfill WHO air quality recommendations, according to the most recent urban air quality database. However, that proportion falls to 56% in high-income nations.
        
        
        The database, which currently covers 3000 locations in 103 countries, has nearly doubled during the past two years as more towns measure air pollution levels and acknowledge the accompanying health implications.</p>

      <p>Description: According to statistics on household air pollution, kerosene used for cooking and incomplete combustion of solid fuels cause 3.2 million premature deaths each year from illnesses. For further information, see household air pollution data. Particulate matter and other pollutants in household air pollution irritate the lungs and airways, weaken the immune system, and decrease the blood's ability to carry oxygen. These 3.2 million deaths from exposure to indoor air pollution include:

        Ischemic heart disease accounts for 32% of cases. exposure to household air pollution causes nearly a million premature deaths annually, or 12% of all fatalities from ischemic heart disease;
        The stroke rate is 23%. The everyday exposure to indoor air pollution brought on by the burning of solid fuels and kerosene at home accounts for about 12% of all stroke-related deaths;</p>
